# CROP-PREDICTION-USING-AI-ML-INTERN
Crop Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
Crop prediction using machine learning is a vital application of data science in agriculture. This project aims to predict the most suitable crop to cultivate based on various environmental factors like temperature, rainfall, humidity, soil type, and pH level. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system assists farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop selection, thereby enhancing productivity and optimizing resource utilization.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes historical agricultural data including climate records, soil characteristics, and crop yields for training the machine learning model.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling for effective model training.
- **Model Selection**: Employs various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks to predict crop suitability.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective model.
- **Deployment**: Provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to input their location and environmental conditions, generating predictions on the best-suited crops for cultivation.
- **Visualization**: Presents insights through interactive visualizations depicting the relationship between environmental factors and crop recommendations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask (for deployment)
